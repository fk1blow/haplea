# Indexing

- ranking is title > tags > ingredients

## metadata extraction

We need some sort of ranking so that we can differentiate between a token found on the second
paragraph, and a token found on the recipe's title.

A document that matches a token on the recipe's title would be ranked higher
than one which contains the token at the end of the recipe.

Ranking is: **title > tags > ingredients**
