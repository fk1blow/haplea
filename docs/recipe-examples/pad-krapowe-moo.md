## ingredients

- 300g ground pork
- 4-5 cloves garlic, minced
- 2-4 Thai bird's eye chillies, minced (adjust to taste)
- 1 cup Thai basil leaves
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 egg
- Vegetable oil for cooking
- Cooked jasmine rice for serving

## instructions

Mince garlic and chillies. Heat oil in a hot wok or pan over high heat. Toast garlic and chillies until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add ground pork and stir-fry, breaking it up until cooked through. Add fish sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sugar, mixing well. Toss in Thai basil and sauté until wilted and fragrant. In a separate pan, fry egg in hot oil, spooning oil over top to crisp the edges. Serve pork over jasmine rice topped with the crispy fried egg.

## notes

The dish should be spicy and fragrant - don't skimp on the chillies! Thai basil (not regular basil) is essential for authentic flavor. The runny yolk mixing with the rice is part of the experience!
