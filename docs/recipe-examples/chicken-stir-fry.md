## instructions

Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces and marinate in soy sauce. Heat wok over high heat with oil. Stir-fry chicken until cooked through, remove. Add vegetables in order of cooking time - carrots first, then broccoli, peppers, ending with snap peas. Return chicken, add sauce, toss until glossy. Serve over rice.

## notes

The key to good stir-fry is high heat and not overcrowding the pan. Prep all ingredients before you start cooking.
