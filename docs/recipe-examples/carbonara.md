## instructions

Cook spaghetti in salted boiling water. Meanwhile, crisp guanciale in a pan. Whisk eggs with pecorino romano. Drain pasta, reserving pasta water. Toss hot pasta with guanciale off heat, then quickly mix in egg mixture, adding pasta water to create creamy sauce. Serve immediately with extra pecorino.

## notes

The key is to mix the eggs off heat to prevent scrambling. Use pecorino, not parmesan - it makes a difference!
