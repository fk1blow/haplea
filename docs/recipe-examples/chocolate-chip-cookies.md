## ingredients

- 225g butter, softened
- 150g granulated sugar
- 165g brown sugar, packed
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 280g all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 300g chocolate chips

## instructions

Cream butter and sugars until fluffy. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Mix flour, baking soda, and salt separately, then fold into wet ingredients. Stir in chocolate chips. Chill dough for 30 minutes. Scoop onto baking sheets and bake at 350°F for 10-12 minutes until golden at edges.

## notes

Chilling the dough is crucial for texture. Under-bake slightly for chewier cookies - they'll firm up as they cool.
